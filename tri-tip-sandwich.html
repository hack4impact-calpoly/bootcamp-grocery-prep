    <h1>Tri Tip Sandwich</h1>
    <p>
        It's not quite Firestone Grill, but it'll have to work. Inspired by the Central Coaster's take on the classic tri
        tip sandwich, this recipe is sure to give you the fuel you need to grind out that late night midterm preparation.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tri tip roast (2 1/2 to 3 pounds)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fresh ground pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 stick of butter</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic, peeled and smashed</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 package Old Country French Dip Rolls (6 rolls)</li>
        <li>18 ounce bottle Sweet Baby Ray’s Hickory & Brown Sugar barbecue sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the meat with salt, pepper, and garlic powder on all sides. Refrigerate overnight.</li>
        <li>Remove the meat from refrigerator about 2 hours before cooking to allow meat to come to room temperature. Heat the oven to 425 degrees, and cook the trip tip for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the meat is cooking, melt the butter in a small sauce pan over low heat. Remove from heat and stir in the smashed garlic and salt. Let it sit so the garlic will infuse the butter.</li>
        <li>Toward the end of the oven cooking time, prepare a barbecue grill by pre-heating to very high heat. Once the oven cooking time is finished, transfer the meat to the grill and cook very quickly on each side, just enough to get a sear/grill marks (30-60 seconds per side).</li>
        <li>When the searing is finished, remove the meat from the grill, and allow to rest for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the meat is resting, lower the heat of the grill to medium, and warm the barbecue sauce in a small saucepan on the grill (can also be done on the stove). Separate the french rolls halves and place on the grill to toast the bread. At this point, you can also place the saucepan of melted better on the grill to re-heat it.</li>
        <li>Once the meat has rested, thinly slice it across the grain 1/8″ thick.</li>
        <li>To assemble the sandwich, brush each toasted bread half with the melted garlic butter. Pile on a generous portion of the meat on the bottom bread half, spoon on the warm barbecue sauce, and top with the other half of bread.</li>
        <li>Slice in half, and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
