        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp neutral oil (like safflower or grapeseed)</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 knob ginger, cut into matchsticks</li>
            <li>Sea salt</li>
            <li>2 tbsp coconut oil or more neutral oil</li>
            <li>3 scallions, thinly sliced, white and green parts separated</li>
            <li>1 lb ground turkey</li>
            <li>2 tbsp lime juice</li>
            <li>1 tbsp fish sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp sugar or honey (optional)</li>
            <li>Rice or noodles</li>
            <li>2/3 cup cilantro, chopped</li>
            <li>1/3 cup torn basil leaves</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a cold 12-inch skillet, combine oil, garlic and ginger. Place over medium heat until sizzling, then continue to cook, stirring frequently, until garlic and ginger are golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate and sprinkle lightly with salt.</li>
            <li>Add coconut oil to pan, then stir in scallion whites and cook until starting to brown, about 2 minutes. Stir in red-pepper flakes and cook for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Stir in turkey, raise heat to medium-high, and cook, breaking up meat with a spoon, until golden and crisp, about 7 minutes. Donâ€™t stir the meat too much, so it can turn deep brown.</li>
            <li>Remove pan from heat and stir in lime juice, fish sauce and soy sauce. Taste and add more lime juice, red-pepper flakes, soy sauce and sugar or honey if you like.</li>
            <li>Gently mix about two-thirds of the fried garlic and ginger into the turkey. Serve turkey over rice, topped with cilantro, basil and scallion greens and garnish with remaining fried ginger and garlic.</li>
        </ol>
