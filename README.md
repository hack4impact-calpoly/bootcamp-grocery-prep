2020 bootcamp project - Jonathon Banh

this repo will serve as a place to "turn in" your work. more info about bootcamp can be found on the [bootcamp resources notion page](https://www.notion.so/h4i/Bootcamp-Resources-995537643dec454099abd859d8c02643).

to submit your work, create a pull request from your own fork (do not merge if you are able to). this allows us to review your work in a reasonably quick manner.

as always, if you have any questions, feel free to DM Ethan on Slack :)
