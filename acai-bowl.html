    <h1>Acai Bowl</h1>
    <p>
        Typically enjoyed after breaking a personal record at the recreation center, after finishing that difficult 
        route at the climbing wall, or even after going months without intense excercise, the acai bowl is essential
        to the Cal Poly student's diet. Loaded with micronutrients and inspired by ShakeSmart's campus- and 
        nationally-acclaimed acai bowls, this dish is an accessible, healthy, and refreshing option, especially for breakfast.

        <li>Top the bowl with as much (or as little) of your favorites such as granola, fresh (thinly sliced) fruit, chia seeds, and coconut! I recommend drizzling on about a tablespoon of honey over everything. Enjoy immediately.</li>
