    <h1>About the Chef</h1>
    <p>Bonjour food lovers! If you're anything like me, you can appreciate a
    good meal, but the stress of planning recipes and going shopping often
    stops you from cooking.</p>
    <p>That's why I made this site! A place of hand selected recipes, and a
    super easy way to organize your grocery list, this should be a way to make
    college cooking delightful.</p>

      <h2>My Life</h2>
      <p>Now this wouldn't be a recipe site without going into too much detail
      about the author's life, so here we are.</p>

      <h3>Growing Up</h3>
      <p>I grew up buying school lunches, treating food as a fuel for my body.
      This was fine for a while, but the monotony of eating hamburgers and
      chicken nuggets every day eventually got to me.</p>
      <p>I distinctly remember going home and packing my lunch with a turkey
      sandwhich, ready to make serious change. While this sandwhich was
      <em>mediocore</em> (at best), it still marked a serious change in my life.
      From that day forward, <strong>I was commited to learning how to
        cook</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Now</h3>
      <p>Now, many years later, I am able to make spaghetti, cook eggs, and
      even bake brownies! This growth is something I am extremely proud of,
      and I hope that you are able to follow a similar journey as mine!</p>
