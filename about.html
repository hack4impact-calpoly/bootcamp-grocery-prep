        <h1>About the Chef</h1>
        <p>Hello! I'm a 2nd year college student who absolutely hates the stress and hassle of meal prepping and cooking.</p>
        <p>I made this site to share some tips and tricks in navigating meal prep and cooking as a busy student.</p>
        <h2>My Life</h2>
        <p>Here's a little bit about me!</p>
        <h3>Growing Up</h3>
        <p>I grew up with 2 parents who loved cooking and a sister who loves baking. Unfortunately, I did not get any of their cooking talent.</p>
        <p>Before I went to college, I was determined to learn some easy and simple recipes that I could make at school.</p>
        <h3>Now</h3>
        <p>Now, I am no longer too terrible of a cook and am able to make a couple simple recipes.</p>
