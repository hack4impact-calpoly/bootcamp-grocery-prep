         <p>Hello there. I definitely wouldn't call myself a cook or claim
         any real skill within the kitchen, but I have at least learned enough
         throughout my life to sustain a somewhat healthly diet. </p>
         
         <p>That being said, I tried to just pick some recipes that would be easy to understand.</p>
         
         <h2>Life</h2>
         
         <p> I grew up paying some limited attention to my mother and grandma cook.
         I also attained skill in making random things that I like that weren't
         necessarily things my family would be making for household dinner.</p>
         
         <p>Anyway, now I have started to learn more recipes from my mom and auntie
         since we cook a lot more at home. I don't quite have all those meals
         quite down yet, so the page still consists of mediocre quasi recipes,
         if you could even call them that. Enjoy.</p>
