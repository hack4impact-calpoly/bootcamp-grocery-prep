    <p>Hey everyone! If you love food in any capacity, you've come to the 
        right place.</p>
    <p>This website was born out of my need to quickly come up with a deliverable 
        for the H4I Bootcamp. </p>

      <h2>Backstory</h2>
      <p>Below I will go into detail about the genesis of this site.</p>

      <h3>My Inspiration</h3>
      <p> In high school, I spent six months living abroad as a foreign 
          exchange student in Australia. My host mother was kind enough to offer to
           make me lunch every day. Always a people pleaser, when she asked me what I wanted
        her to make, I told her whatever was easiest. </p>
      <p><em>I will always rue that day. </em></p>
      <p> From that day forward, she started making me lettuce salads for lunch.
        Sometimes there were cucumbers, sometimes not. But basically it was just
        a pile of lettuce with no dressing. That's when I knew I had to start cooking
        for myself.</p>

          </figure>
        
        <h3>Now</h3>
      <p>Now, as a college student, I understand my host mom's struggle. I am short on 
          both money and time, so convinience is my top priority. I have figured out how to 
          make my own food, and I am choosing to share some recipes on this website.
