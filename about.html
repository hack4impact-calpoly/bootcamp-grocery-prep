         <h1>About the Chef</h1>
         <p>Hey waddup guys I don't know if anyone actually will read this but
            if you do maybe you have no life (just kidding) but yea I don't 
            really know what to put in here because I don't really cook any 
            food but now I kinda have to learn cuz buying food all the time 
            is expensive and I don't wanna go broke
         </p>
         <p>That's why I make this site, to actually do the assignment for
            hack4impact and not because I like cooking. That's all for today
         </p>
         <h2>My Life</h2>
         <p>Don't even bother being curious about my life since it is boring;
            well not really but kind of.
         </p>
         <h3>Growing Up</h3>
         <p>My mom usually cooks for me or when I was little my grandma or
            our maid also cooked for us. We do not hire any maids anymore
            because it's hard to find any and the last time we do hire maids
            they <em>escaped</em> by climbing over the fence and I promise we did not
            treat them badly :(
         </p>
         <p>I realized when I moved to the US that food is expensive if we do not 
            cook it by ourselves so that's why <strong>I am committed to learn how to cook
            </strong>
         </p>
         <h3>Now</h3>
         <p>Now, I'm back in Indonesia so for the moment I do not need to worry
            about cooking anything but I promise I'm learning
         </p>
