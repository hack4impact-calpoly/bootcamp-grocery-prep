        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Hello dog lovers! If you're like me, you can appreciate some good dog pics.</p>
        <p>That's why I made this site! A place of some of my favorite dog pics.</p>
        <h2>My Life</h2>
        <p>Now this wouldn't be a good dog site without going into much detail about the author's life...</p>
        <h3>Growing Up</h3>
        <p>I grew up wanting a dog so bad, but after a trip to the allergy doctor, I found out that I was allergic to dogs!</p>
        <p>I distinctly remember being sad about not getting a dog. While this news was sad, I didn't let it stop me from getting my pooch</p>

        <h3>Now</h3>
        <p>Now, many years later, I am able to have a dog! I grew out of my allergy, and my family and I were able to adopt this cute little dog at the rescue shelter!</p>
