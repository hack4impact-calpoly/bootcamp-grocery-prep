        <h1>About the Chef</h1>
        <p>Bonjour food lovers! If you're anything like me, you can appreciate a good meal, but the stress of planning recipes and going shopping often stops you from cooking.</p>
        <p>That's why I made this site! A place of hand selected recipes, and a super easy way to organize your grocery list, this should be a way to make college cooking delightful.</p>

        <h1>My life</h1>
        <p>Now this wouldn't be a recipe site without going into too much detail about the author's life, so here we are.</p>
        <h2>Growing Up</h2>
        <p>I always had dinner leftovers for lunch. They tasted good. I like me mums cooking. yummy yummy in my tummy.</p>

        <h2>Now</h2>
        <p>I love eating, but I still don't like cooking. I know how to make fried rice and play Overcooked. I honestly should've made this a baking website.</p>
