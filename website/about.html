    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I eat a lot when I'm bored. This lead me to the creations 
      you see here on this website.</p>
    <p>Hopefully you get something good out of it... and not a stomachache or something.</p>

      <h2>My Life</h2>
      <p>I am simply a man living in an absurdist world.</p>

      <h3>Growing Up</h3>
      <p>Growing up as a bored eater, I tended to eat food whenever I was bored. I mean when you're 
      bored you can do lots of things. So why not eat?</p>
      <h3>Now</h3>
      <p>Now, many years later, I am able to make spaghetti, cook eggs, and
      even bake brownies! This growth is something I am extremely proud of,
      and I hope that you are able to follow a similar journey as mine!</p>
