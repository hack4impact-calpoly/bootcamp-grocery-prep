        <p>
            There's nothing I love more than coming back from classes to a steaming hot homemade dinner, but it's difficult to get that
            especially if you're not living with your family (or you don't have a live-in chef).
        </p>
        <p>
            Luckily, there are a few recipes I've learned that could help somewhat replicate that experience! I'd love to share them with
            all of you because my ultimate goal is for you to become a better cook than me, so I can start crashing your meals :D
        </p>

        <h1>My Life</h1>
        <p>I know you're all asking this question, how did I learn these recipes?</p>
        <h2 class="highlight">Growing Up</h2>
        <p>My parents had long commutes and would usually not come home from work before us, so my sister and I were typically responsible
            for dinner.
        </p>
        <p>While my sister went on to become a great cook (+baker) and eventually opened her own bakery, I became an expert
            in boiling water and stirring the pot.
        </p>
        <h2 class="highlight">High School</h2>
        <p>
            When I was 16, I decided to move to the U.S. to finish high school. My parents sent me to this semi-boarding high school, and
            I lived in a dorm with 15 other girls. While we did have a small dining hall situation, the food was low-quality, to put it
            lightly. To defend ourselves from bone-dry meatballs and stale pasta (seriously, how do you mess up pasta?!), we all learned
            to cook a few simple recipes.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is when I gained most of my cooking skills. Although my roommate started taking quite an interest in meal-prepping and I
            slowly got demoted to being her assistant. I'm not complaining tho, her food was bomb!
        </p>
        <h2 class="highlight">College</h2>
        <p>Lol it's quarantine baby, I moved back to live with my aunt and didn't have to cook most of the time.</p>
