        <h2>About the chef</h2> 
        <p>I have been cooking for many years already and have a bunch of dishes that I can cook. 
            I like to cook delicious and nutritious food for myself. <br>
            I wanted to share my favorite things I like to make with you guys as it is easy and convenient. 
            Thanks for stopping by!

        <h2>My life</h2>
        <p>I have grown up very picky when it came to food, but when I reached middle school. I started to try new and different
             foods and I grew to like them. <br>
             I now enjoy an assortment of foods and always like to try something new. It wasn't until highschool that I asked my
             mother how to cook. <br>
             I loved my mother's cooking and wanted to learn for the future as the food she cooked was really healthy for the mind
             and soul. <br>
             Even now in college, I still cook my favorite meals that I learned from my mom and I always enjoy them.
             It because it makes me feel like I'm at home.
