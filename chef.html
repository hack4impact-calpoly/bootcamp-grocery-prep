        <h2>Where I Am, and Where I was Before</h2>
        <p>Below you can find a little bit more about me and where my love of cooking came from</p>
        <h3>Growing Up</h3>
        <p>My dad and mom were excellent cooks and chefs and eating their food was always marvelous. </p>
        <p>The way they could take a handful of ingredients and turn it into something spectacular always blew my mind! </p>
        <p>As I became older I started helping out with dinner and lunch and thus grew my love of cooking and baking</p>
        <p>My stepdad was an excellent breakfast chef and from him I learned how to perfect the omlet and many other breakfast items</p>
        <h2>Now</h2>
        <p>I cook dinner when I can and I love baking with my sister. 
          <a href="mango_curry.html">Mango Chicken Curry</a> is probably my favorite to cook!
        </p>
