      <h1>About the Chef</h1>
      <p>Hey everybody! I have been learning how to cook throughout this last querter. I know some of you 
          would like to learn so here I am documenting my journey.
      </p>
      <p>I made this site solely for the purpose of sharing my knowledge and not for the Hack4Impact bootcamp project</p>
      
      <h2>My Life</h2>
      <p>Let me waste a bit of your time while you are trying to find the recipe ingredients!</p>
      <h3>Pre-college</h3>
      <p>Before college I only knew how to cook simple things. Quesadillas happened to be my specialty.</p>
      <p>Even into freshman year I still knew very little. This is due to the fact that I was scammed by the Cal Poly dorms. We 
          were told there was a kitchen on every floor; this is not the case. There is a microwave and a water fountain on every floor. 
          I do not know how this is ethically ok, but nothing I can do about it now...
      </p>
      <h3>Now</h3>
      <p>Now I'm in my second year and I finally have a kitchen. After wating this long, I cannot back down anymore.
           I hope you enjoy my recipes - I do at least.
      </p>
